Hi Shiela!

Wow, what a great job! I think it's amazing how hard you have applied yourself and what you have achieved. You've really tried to experiment here and it's fantastic!

It's worth taking the time to really appreciate how much you have learnt in the last few months. I know you put in a LOT of work at home, and I hope you think it has been worth it. I'm very proud of what you have done in this course.

Välgodkänt, extremely well done.

CRITERIA FOR GRADING

*************************************

GODKÄNT:
-------------------------------------

HTML
  index.html at root level for publishing on github pages ✅

  Multiple pages ✅

  Header, footer and navigational menu on all main pages (where possible) ✅

  H1 on every page ✅

  Mail to Contact form ✅

  Links to specific projects opening in new windows ✅     

CSS
  External CSS ✅

  General style sheets for common elements ✅

  Typography style sheet ✅
    With the @font-face rule you can use the same font-family name with different font weights. The css will work out which file to use based on the font weight. So you don't need blackjack2 as a name.... but I don't think it's being used anywhere?

  Locally installed font ✅
  
  Separate stylesheets for each page ✅

  RWD
    Desktop ✅
    Mobile ✅

JS
  jQuery plugin (such as a carousel) ✅
    Nice choice!

  JS/jQuery multi level menu (min 2 levels) ✅
-------------------------------------

VÄLGODKÄNT:
-------------------------------------

  Project organisation ✅ 
    +1, excellent

  CSS prefixing where required ❌
    You can copy and paste an entire file into something like https://autoprefixer.github.io/ and it will do all the work for you!

  jQuery effects ✅ 

  Semantic element naming ✅

  Code style ✅
  CSS:
    Beautiful, missed a few indentations but very easy to read.
    .cardsHangman etc should be .cards-hangman
  HTML:
    Too many empty lines
    +1 - nearly all imgs have alt attributes, well done!
  JS: 
    mobileActive - it's a class so should be 'mobile-active'
    Lots of empty lines that can be removed
    The spiral is a great idea and effect, probably better to do it in pure css as a background image that repeats.
